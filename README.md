## 🙋‍♂️ Who am I
Originally from Greece, I am currently based in Athens, Greece, working as Javascript Engineer.

Even though I work as a full stack engineer, having Node.js and PHP as my backend side, I am a big fan of web technologies, specifically PWAs and web APIs.
I love to constantly experiment them in side projects.
